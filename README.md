# PyRemedy #

*A simple remedy for remedy*

## Introduction ##

PyRemedy is a simple library for interacting with Remedy ARS in Python.  It
primarily focuses on CRUD operations.

I intend for this library to stay simple and minimal, therefore I kindly ask
that any additional major features are not submitted.  You're welcome to fork
this project if you wish to extend it and build a more complete interface for
Remedy ARS similar to PyARS.

## Documentation ##

Please refer to the Sphinx documentation for instructions on using PyRemedy.  
You may generate the documentation as follows:

``` python
pip install sphinx
cd docs
make html
```

Documentation will then be available under **docs/_build/html/index.html**.
